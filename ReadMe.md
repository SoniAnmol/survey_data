## 1. Description

This repository is created to extract the key insights from the survey responses collected through the survey questionnaire prepared for this research.

The survey aims to gather information on the attributes of the Narrative Policy Framework (NPF), including the Hero, Villain, Victim, and Moral of the Story.

The survey questionnaire ([Italian](https://github.com/SoniAnmol/survey_data/raw/main/data/survey_questionnaire/cc-perspective-Italian_-_Pilot_1.docx) | [English](https://github.com/SoniAnmol/survey_data/raw/main/data/survey_questionnaire/cc-perspective-Italian_-_Pilot_1_eng.docx)) is coded and distributed through Qualtrics platform.

This repository is part of Anmol Soni's PhD project. Further project details and relevant links will be added to this description soon.

### 1.1 Next steps

The attributes identified through the NPF will later be compared and integrated with the attributes of macro-narratives of floods collected from newspaper articles in the subsequent stages of this research.
